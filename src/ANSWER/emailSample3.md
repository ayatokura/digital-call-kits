**From:** Org Leader

**Subject:** Keep up the momentum with your Call for Code projects!  

**Body:**

Team,

I'd like to extend my personal thanks to everyone who came together for our Call for Code Day last week. Everyone put their hearts, minds and time into answering the call. Let's keep the momentum going and take the input that you've received and apply it to make your solution rock solid and ready to submit.

Meet with your team members today or tomorrow to draw up a plan to get your project finished within the next few weeks. Check with your manager (forward this email if you like) about getting a little discretionary time set aside for your work on this project aligned with our corporate responsibility initiatives.

Now might be a good time to double check the rules, too.
