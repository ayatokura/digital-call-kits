**Body:**

Team,

I wanted make you all aware of a developer-focused global challenge to help improve disaster preparedness using technology. It's called Call for Code, and I'm proud to tell you that as a lab, we will run a Call for Code Day on [insert date]. Call for Code is supporting the UN Human Rights office, and The International Network of The American Red Cross, and projects will be built on IBM Cloud

On average, **every day** natural disasters will directly impact 80,000 people, costing the global economy more than $270 million. What if technology could help improve these figures? That's exactly what Call for Code is setting out to do. It asks developers to work out how to use AI, Blockchain, Cloud, Data, and IoT technologies most effectively to improve communities' disaster preparedness and resiliency.

This is a competitive challenge, but unlike any other hackathon, the winners will be working with The American Red Cross and IBM's Corporate Service Corps to deploy the solution on-site in 2019. As part of the Call for Code, there will be a separate challenge for IBMers and I'll be proud to announce that we have a team of developers among our ranks who're changing the world for the better.

You can learn more about the specifics of the challenge at callforcode.org, and we'll be following up shortly with another email about pre-event training that you should complete before our Call for Code Day.

This is a truly worthwhile project, and I'm looking forward to seeing a lot of you at our Call for Code Day.
