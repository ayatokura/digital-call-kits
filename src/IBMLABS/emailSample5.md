**Body:**

Team,

I wanted to reach out to you personally to thank you for your participation in Call for Code. Submissions have closed and the judging will begin, and I'm hoping that we'll have one of our lab's projects selected as finalists or even IBMer challenge winners.

I'm confident you've all done an incredible job and you've found this a fun and worthwhile experience, and if you've had a great experience with any of the technology you've used, I'd love to hear from you.
